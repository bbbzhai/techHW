    Your heuristic for the FoodSearchProblem goes here.

    This heuristic must be consistent to ensure correctness.  First, try to come up
    with an admissible heuristic; almost all admissible heuristics will be consistent
    as well.

    If using A* ever finds a solution that is worse uniform cost search finds,
    your heuristic is *not* consistent, and probably not admissible!  On the other hand,
    inadmissible or inconsistent heuristics may find optimal solutions, so be careful.

    The state is a tuple ( pacmanPosition, foodGrid ) where foodGrid is a
    Grid (see game.py) of either True or False. You can call foodGrid.asList()
    to get a list of food coordinates instead.

    If you want access to info like walls, capsules, etc., you can query the problem.
    For example, problem.walls gives you a Grid of where the walls are.

    If you want to *store* information to be reused in other calls to the heuristic,
    there is a dictionary called problem.heuristicInfo that you can use. For example,
    if you only want to count the walls once and store that value, try:
      problem.heuristicInfo['wallCount'] = problem.walls.count()
    Subsequent calls to this heuristic can access problem.heuristicInfo['wallCount']
